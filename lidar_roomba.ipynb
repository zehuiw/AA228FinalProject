The first argument for both resamplers is the number of particles that represent the belief state. The lidar resampler takes a low-variance resampler as an additional argument, implemented for us in ```ParticleFilters.jl```, which is responsible for efficiently resampling a weighted set of particles. \n",

    "### Specifying initial states and beliefs\n",
    "If, for debugging purposes, you would like to hard-code a starting location or initial belief state for the roomba, you can do so by taking the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define the initial state using the following line of code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "is = RoombaState(x,y,th,0.)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where ```x``` and ```y``` are the x,y coordinates of the starting location and ```th``` is the heading in radians. The last entry, ```0.```, respresents whether the state is terminal, and should remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to initialize the Roomba's belief as perfectly localized, you can do so with the following line of code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "b0 = Deterministic(is)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you would like to initialize the standard unlocalized belief, use these lines:\n",
    "```\n",
    "dist = initialstate_distribution(m)\n",
    "b0 = initialize_belief(belief_updater, dist)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, we call the ```stepthrough``` function using the initial state and belief as follows:\n",

    "stepthrough(m,planner,belief_updater,b0,is,max_steps=300)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discretizing the state space\n",
    "Certain POMDP solution techniques require discretizing the state space. Should we need to do so, we first define the state space by specifying the number of points to discretize the range of possible x, y, and $\\theta$ values, and then calling the DiscreteRoombaStateSpace constructor.\n",

    "Certain POMDP solution techniques require discretizing the observation space. The Bumper sensor has a discrete observation space by default, while the Lidar sensor is continuous by default. The observations can take values in the range $[0,\\infty)$. Should we need to do discretize the Lidar observation space, we first define cut-points $x_{1:K}$ such that all observations between $-\\infty$ and $x_1$ are considered the discrete observation 1, all observations between $x_1$ and $x_2$ are considered discrete observation 2, and so on. All observations between $x_K$ and $\\infty$ are considered discrete observation $K+1$. We instantiate the discretized sensor as follows:\n",
